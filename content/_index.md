**Salut! Hi! Hallo!**

I am Dany, a Québécois living in the beautiful city of [Freiburg im
Breisgau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freiburg_im_Breisgau) in Germany. I
speak French 🇨🇦, English and German 🇩🇪.

For the past 12+ years, I have worked as a **Software / DevOps Engineer**.
Beside work, I enjoy hiking, bouldering, playing board games, gardening, and
anything related to technology.
